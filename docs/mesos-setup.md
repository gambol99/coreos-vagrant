#### **Mesos + Marathon + Service Discovery Setup**
--------------------------
A short list / group of instructions to being

    # Being up the CoreOS cluster of you haven't done so already; check the docs/ for the howto;

    $ export FLEETCTL_ENDPOINT=http://10.0.1.101:4001
    $ fleetctl list-machines
    # if not, run the fixup, as i've had issues with the discovery service
    $ service/coreos-fixup
    $ fleetctl list-machines

    # Lets bring up some utility services (service discovery)
    $ cd services/
    $ fleetctl start consul-master.service
    $ fleetctl start consul-slave@[0-9]+.service
    $ fleetctl start registrator.service

    # Docker Service Proxy for auto-wiring of containers
    $ fleetctl start embassy.service

Now we can bring up the Apache Mesos cluster, starting with the Zookeeper config.

    # Bring up the zookeeper instance (note, this needs to be clustered at some point)
    $ fleetctl start zookeeper.service

    # Bring up the mesos-master and slaves
    # fleetctl start mesos-master.service
    # ...
    # fleetctl list-units

    # Check which machine the master is running on and then open a browser http://<IP>:5050

    # Start up the slaves
    $ fleetctl start mesos-slave.service

    # View in master ui to check when the slaves are registered and ready to use. Once there, we can bring up the marathon cluster

    # launch some mesos applications
    alias launch="curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://10.0.1.102:8080/v2/apps -d"
    $ launch @frontend.json

    $ fleetctl start marathon.service
    # Once done ... open a browser to any of the CoreOS machines: http://IP:8080 and you should be the Marathon UI.

    # There is a number of services in the services/demo directory;
          - a frontend connected to a redis cache and x number of mysql slaves
          - a backend which would be connected to a master and slave mysql
          - a database master and x number of slaves replicating

    note: All the above use the Service Proxy to auto-wire and load balancer the connections between them.
